       "\"  \\n![customers](./images/shopping.jpg)\\n# 1. Introduction\\n\\n\\nCustomer personality analysis is an interesting topic for companies. The dataset is from a competition on Kaggle. To \\npractice and solve the binary classification problems, I have trained 5 machine learning models to this dataset to \\npredict the customers’ response to the marketing campaign, accepting the offer or not, and identified the important \\ninfluential features behind it.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe capstone project contains four parts: data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, preprocessing, final model selection\\n and prediction.The data cleaning includes filling in null values, removing less useful features, and organizing the \\ncategories within the features. EDA is using visualization tools, like bar plots and histograms to look at the \\ndistribution of independent features and their relations to the dependent feature. The preprocessing and training \\nsession split data into train/test datasets, trained and tuned 5 different machine learning models. In the last session,\\n select the best model based on the metric ‘roc_auc” score, refit the model using all available data and predict the \\ncustomers’ response.\\n# 2. Data Cleaning and Wrangling\\n  \\n![Expenses per Products](./images/expenses.jpg)  \\n![Expenses per Age](./images/expenses2.jpg)\\n# 3. Exploratory Data Analysis\\n  \\n![Six marketing champaign](./images/campaign.jpg)  \\n![Total expenses](./images/total_expenses1.jpg)  \\n![PCA](./images/pca.jpg)\\n\\n**The first two components account for about 60% of the variance, and the first five for over 95%.**   \\n  \\n![PCA colored by Total expenses](./images/pca2.jpg)\\n\\nThe red points representing the upper quartile of 'TotalExpense' and it spreads across the first dimension. There's also\\n a spread of the other quartiles as well.In this representation, the two principal components account for some 60% of \\nthe variance in the data.  \\n\\n# 4.
