# Introduction


Customer personality analysis is an interesting topic for companies. The dataset is from a competition on Kaggle. To 
practice solving the binary classification problems, I have analyzed this dataset to predict the customersâ€™ response to 
the marketing campaign, accepting the offer or not.



The capstone project contains four parts: data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, preprocessing, final model selection
 and prediction. The exploratory data analysis includes filling in null values, removing less useful features, and 
organizing the categories within the features. The preprocessing section will split data into train/test tests and train
 5 different ML models on the data. In the last session, select the best model and predict.
